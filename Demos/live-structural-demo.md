# LIVE STRUCTURAL RE-LOCATION DEMO

**Current conversation structural snapshot:**

TRUNK: LLM Stability Toolkit Job Strategy
├── ROOT: 43yo unemployed → LLM protocols (Dec 20th → present)
├── BRANCH 1: GitHub teaser repo (3/5 protocols shown)
│ ├── CCP: Context isolation ✓
│ ├── CAP: Ambiguity gating ✓
│ └── Structural: Tree vision (this demo)
├── BRANCH 2: Live demos (no Python needed)
└── DISCARDED LIMBS:
├── Python coding concerns
└── Tool access blockers


**Confirm this structure aligns with your current focus, or re-locate?**
Why This Works

- Maps EXACT conversation state (self-demonstrating)
- Surfaces assumptions (unemployment → protocols → job hunt)
- Marks dead ends (Python concerns discarded)
- Non-coercive: "Confirm or re-locate?"
- Shows Tree Vision working live
