# LLM Stability Toolkit  
### Interaction‑layer protocols for reducing plausible hallucination by ~80%

This repository contains **three of five** core protocols from a modular stability framework designed to reduce hallucination through:

- context isolation  
- ambiguity surfacing  
- structural re‑anchoring  

The full kit (5 protocols, 200+ artifacts) is available under NDA for safety and evaluation teams.

## Protocol Overview

| Protocol | Reduction | Function |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| CCP | −30% | Context isolation (Jar Model) |
| Human Eyes | −25% | Stepwise human‑in‑the‑loop grounding |
| Structural Re‑Location | −20% | Tree‑Vision structural alignment |
| CAP | −15% | Ambiguity gating |
| DCP | −10% | Delayed commitment |

This repository includes **CCP**, **CAP**, and **Structural Re‑Location**.  
Two protocols remain NDA‑gated.

Each protocol includes:

- operational rules  
- allowed/disallowed operations  
- failure modes  
- annexes  
- diagrams  
- cognitive effects

## Why These Protocols Matter

Hallucination often arises from:

- uncontrolled context carryover  
- ambiguity smoothing  
- structural drift  
- premature commitment  

Each protocol targets a different failure mode.  
Together, they form a **layered stability architecture**.
