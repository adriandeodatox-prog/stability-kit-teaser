# LLM Stability Toolkit  
### Interaction‑layer protocols for reducing plausible hallucination by ~80%

A small subset of a larger stability framework focused on interaction‑layer control.  
This teaser includes **three of five** core protocols used to reduce hallucination through:

- context isolation  
- ambiguity surfacing  
- structural re‑anchoring  

The full kit (5 protocols, 200+ artifacts) is available under NDA for safety and evaluation teams.

## Protocol Overview

| Protocol | Reduction | Function |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| CCP | −30% | Context isolation (Jar Model) |
| Human Eyes | −25% | Stepwise human‑in‑the‑loop grounding |
| Structural Re‑Location | −20% | Tree‑Vision structural alignment |
| CAP | −15% | Ambiguity gating |
| DCP | −10% | Delayed commitment |

This repository includes **CCP**, **CAP**, and **Structural Re‑Location**.
