# LLM Stability Toolkit: 80% Hallucination Reduction

Layered interaction protocols w/ diagrams:

- **Clarity Anchor** (-15%): Stops ambiguity cold  
- **Cold Context** (-30%): Jar Model kills context drift  
- **Structural Re-Location** (-20%): Tree Vision re-anchors  

3/5 protocols shown. Full kit + 200+ artifacts under NDA.

## Protocol Overview

The LLM Stability Toolkit implements multiple layers of safeguards to reduce hallucinations during human–AI interaction. Each protocol addresses a different source of potential error:

1. **Clarity Anchor Protocol (CAP)**: Detects ambiguous input and requests clarification before proceeding.  
2. **Cold Context Protocol (CCP)**: Seals prior context, isolates current input, and enforces deterministic parsing.  
3. **Structural Re-Location**: Maps conceptual trees and re-anchors human and LLM understanding on shared structures.  
4. **Human Eyes Protocol** (not shown): 
5. **Delayed Commitment Protocol** (not shown)

**Cumulative effect:** ~80% estimated reduction in plausible hallucination across combined protocols.
