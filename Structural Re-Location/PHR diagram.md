Legend / Notes

Tree Vision Mapping: Maps the conceptual structure, ensuring both participants are aligned.

Participants Re-Located: Ensures both human and model share the same understanding.

Shared Conceptual Snapshot: Explicitly surfaces assumptions, implications, and drift in the conversation.

Effect: Structural Re-Location maintains a shared mental map, which reduces hallucinations caused by unrecognized divergence or shifting assumptions.
